 - all Important Things Will Log Into your Python Executor So Don't Worry about that.
 - Quality of the Project depends on the: Drawing Thickness, Marker Type and Your Device Processor. 
 - To Reduce Unwanted Action or Clicking From Program Make Sure That You Opened Painting Software.

> I Recommend that if you have access to Paint 3D Software, use it as a painter instead of Paint for a variety of reasons, such as : 
>
> 1 - In Paint 3D, the Program Has No Need to Fill R, G, B Inputs and It Can Easily Just Fill The Hex Input (saving time)
>
> 2 -  Paint 3D has More Friendly and Powerful Workspace than Paint Software
>
> etc.

 
> For Better Response (to ensure Keyboard Interrupt is activated) I Highly Recommend you to use Terminal or Command Prompt (CMD) as Python Executor instead of Powershell or IDE Shell.
